# Boost Compression Calculator
Turbo Boost &amp; Compression Calculator

Welcome to my boost and compression calculator. This software was originally
tested on a BMW set up but is universal.

<h3>Setup</h3>
You can easily modify the parts (Crankshaft, pistons, etc.)
by changing how they are selected. Please make sure to change
the selectors to the ID's of your html page.

Without changing the selectors this script will not function
properly.
